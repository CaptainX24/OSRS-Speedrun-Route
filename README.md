# OSRS-Speedrun-Route

## Overview:

Welcome to the wonderful world of Oldschool RuneScape speedrunning. OSRS offers a surprisingly unique, challenging, and rewarding speedrun. We are an aweseme and friendly community, so please ask questions in the Discord.

This git repository stores up to date and archived route notes for the most active run category: "Champion's Guild"

#### Files

**authenticator-basic.txt:** Bare bones route notes. Technically contains all information needed for a run, but not for the uninitiated.

**authenticator-verbose.txt:** More verbose route notes. Recommended for non-experienced runners.

 **old-route.txt:** Deprecated route notes. Outdated, but neat.
