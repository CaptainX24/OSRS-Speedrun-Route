# OSRS-Speedrun-Route

## Routes:

**authenticator-basic.txt:** Bare bones route notes. Technically contains all information needed for a run, but not for the uninitiated.

**authenticator-verbose.txt:** More verbose route notes. Recommended for non-experienced runners.

 **old-route.txt:** Deprecated route notes. Outdated, but neat.
