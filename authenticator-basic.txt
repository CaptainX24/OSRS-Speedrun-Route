Setup
    Create an email account for runs, as email verification is required.
    The best thing you can do is setup a short and memorable gmail account "usernamerun@gmail.com".
    When setting up the runescape account, you can use the email "usernamerun+1@gmail.com", and increment it by one each run.
    Your runescape login will be "usernamerun+1@gmail.com" and the authentication email will go to "usernamerun@gmail.com".
    Make a new oldschool runescape account.
    Go to the main oldschool page and click enable authenticator.
    Open google authenticator on your phone and scan the code.
    Enter the code on the web page to enable authenticator.
    Log in on the client and enter the authenticator code.
