Setup
Create an email account for runs, as email verification is required
The best thing you can do is setup a short and memorable gmail account "usernamerun@gmail.com"
Then, when setting up the runescape account, you can use the email "usernamerun+1@gmail.com", and increment it by one each run
Your runescape login email will be "usernamerun+1@gmail.com" and the authentication email will go to "usernamerun@gmail.com"
Make a new oldschool runescape account
Go to the main oldschool page and click enable authenticator
Open google authenticator on your phone and scan the code
Enter the code on the web page to enable authenticator
Log in on the client and enter the authenticator code

Note: The first time you change world with this account you will be brought back to the authenicater verification
    Hit cancel, and then enter your username and password again
